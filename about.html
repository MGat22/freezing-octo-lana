      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p><span class= "companyname">Bubble Under</span> is a group of diving enthusiast based in the
      south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer
      months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are
      flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut
      the costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that
      everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
      <p><span class= "companyname">Bubble Under</span>
      <p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on
      our own turf: past diving weekends away have included
      trips up to Scap Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous
      wreck sites.</p>
      <p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to
      talk about our recent adventures (<em>any</em> excuse, eh?)</p>
      <p>Or as our man Bob Dobalina would put it:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Happiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or
        two of Old Speckland Hen. You can quote me on that!"</p>
      </blockquote>
